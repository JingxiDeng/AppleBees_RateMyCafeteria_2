This is the java demo of Team Applebees for the Donshack24' hackathon.

This repo contains a food rating system where users, from the keyboard, will be able to enter reviews for a food item of their choice into an object called **FoodRatingList**
FoodRatingList contains a list of foods that are available in the fictional cafeteria that this project is trying simulate. 
Each individual food item also contains its own list of reviews from various users. 
Each review from a particular includes information such as the username of the user who gave the rating, a number rating out of 5 rating the dish, a text review, and a counter that records whether the user would like to see the dish more often in the cafe in the future.

Please run src/main/java/FoodRatingList/Main for the demo.
